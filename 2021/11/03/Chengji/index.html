Later, Liang Sicheng proposed to “plant flowers and grasses and install park chairs” on the old city walls to create a 39.75-kilometer-long three-dimensional park around the city, where people could “overlook the moat and look at the Western Hills or the Forbidden City palace” from the city tower, but this proposal was also rejected.<br>More than 60 years later, Beijing’s “big pie” has been spread to the seventh ring, with haze and traffic congestion, and city planning is now in full swing. Finally, a new “sub-center” is proposed in Baoding and other places, which seems to be the same as the “Liang-Chen plan” of that year.<br>One hundred years ago, Paris faced an urban crisis similar to that of Beijing, with an exploding population, a plague, a toilet in a poor neighborhood usually used by 70 households, and a water tap that became a luxury. Shocked by this situation, Le Corbusier drew up a plan for the City of Tomorrow, systematically blowing up half of central Paris and replacing it with eighteen sixty-story buildings, a nonsense that the Parisians, of course, ignored. The architect’s idea is excellent, but he forgets that architecture has many things related to human nature in addition to reason.<br>What is a city? The earliest cities were also called city-states, formed by citizens by a specific contract, just like the formation of a state. The development of commerce will inevitably make the city bigger and bigger, with more and more functions and richer connotations. However, the essence should not change - it is first and foremost for the citizens to serve, to let the citizens “live and work.” But in reality, do you have a sense of well-being and living with dignity?<br>Beijing, as the capital, has too many political functions. The leaders at the beginning did not want to build Beijing into a city with only political parts like Washington, D.C., so these conflicts were laid down at that time. The “Great Beijing” program of the “Liang-Chen Program” was not realized, and Beijing was not only demolished with a sigh of relief but also destroyed a thousand years of precipitation and culture; worst of all, the city planning was completely monocentric, spreading from one point to another, spreading in a circle. The pancake, the allocation of resources needs to be coordinated. The essence of the city is that Beijing has been serving the government. Is the city’s core - to serve its citizens - reflected in any way?<br>In this book, Wang Jun describes the rights and wrongs of the past decade or so in a melancholy way. However, the author does not say what is right and wrong but uses the objective perspective of a journalist and hundreds of photos and pictures, as well as a lot of interviews and archival materials, to explain how Beijing was stripped away little by little.<br>I read this quote by Liang Sicheng a long time ago: To peel off a layer of the wall is like peeling off a layer of skin from my body; to tear off a brick is like digging up a piece of flesh from my body. I could only vaguely feel this pain. Later I went to Shanxi and saw the magnificent Yingxian Wooden Pagoda, one of the earliest surviving ancient buildings in China mentioned many times in the “History of Chinese Architecture,” and imagined that if I watched it being destroyed by tourists and slowly growing old and dying, I gradually came to appreciate Mr. Liang’s words. And the Beijing in this book was stripped away bit by bit as if you were witnessing it. And there are many professionals among them, and there are many objective reasons for them. That makes you feel as if Liang Gong is Don Quixote making a last-ditch effort, and you can feel his hopes turning to dust little by little, which hurts so much.<br>The demolition of a city is undoubtedly heartbreaking, especially a unique city in the world, and China may have demolished dozens of cities; the destruction of dozens of cities is indeed terrible, especially the demolition of culture and tradition, and few people reflect on why; although few people remember, but not no, what can be seen is the continued destruction. Today’s bulldozers still do not stop. They still roam through the hutongs and continue to obliterate sections of Beijing’s history. Why do the mistakes continue? Knowing that many of them cannot be done but are driven by substantial economic interests and political rights, many acts are carried out in the city beyond the law in a blatant manner. Who gave them this power? Why do our rules often pale in front of political power? We need a profound reflection at the institutional level.<br>At that time, I happened to be watching “Tokyo Trial.” It was strange that a film was released first when it should be a subject for a documentary. Was it just because the Republican government sent the Chinese judges to the Tokyo trial? The film itself is not difficult to watch, and you can see that the director tried to present this fact objectively and realistically. But the entire film is pervaded by the stamp of revenge, including the Chinese and Japanese in the movie, with a small amount of tolerance as a spice.<br>A trial is based on facts and the law according to Chinese words. Then the presentation of evidence, the finding of guilt or innocence, and reasonable sentencing are the essential elements of a trial as a trial. The writer and director are also trying to find this main line, but it still shows that the writer and director unconsciously skip the evidence and facts and try to use the result to express the justice and victory of revenge. This has been a common Chinese approach for a long time, with the right motive and consequence. Israel spent nearly thirty years after World War II collecting evidence of every Nazi sinner, nailing the crimes to history with evidence in the face of the damage that seemed evident to all. On the other hand, the Chinese have been outraged for seventy years but have rarely kept the evidence as part of their true history.<br>Why put these two events together? There is something similar in them. Maybe it’s a common problem as human beings, as it was in “1993”, “Animal Farm”; maybe it’s also the national nature of our ancient and precocious nation, as it was in “Once Upon a Time in Imperial Politics,” the story of the Great Song. We constantly dwell and burn with passion and always have a “fatal conceit” about ourselves. But this is one of the essential parts of human nature, not ugly. But the people’s desires and efforts are always exploited, and they are ventilated to another group of people. The exploitation of people’s rights becomes a fatal temptation every time.<br>When millions of citizens demolished the walls to scare the sparrows is the same as when Hitler sent millions of German nationals to war, unless it is discussed only in terms of the results. In Beijing, without monuments, everyone can live as usual; in Beijing, without planning, everyone can be stuck in traffic. The same is true for Chinese cities, by and large. It just makes me still think of what someone said, the words of Martin Niemoller inscribed on the Jewish Massacre Memorial in Boston, USA.<br>“In Germany, at first they went after the communists, and I didn’t say anything - because I wasn’t a communist; then they went after the Jews, and I didn’t say anything - because I wasn’t a Jew; then they went after the trade unionists, and I didn’t say anything - because I wasn’t a Jew. Then they went after the trade unionists, and I did not speak up - because I was not a trade unionist; after that, they went after the Catholics, and I did not speak up because I was a Protestant; and finally, they came after me. But no one ever stood up for me again.<br>I remember one early morning in the fall, two good friends and I climbed Jingshan, the rhythmic courtyards of Beijing’s old city, with its green bricks and gray tiles, in a staggered pattern; in the middle of the town, the straight north-south axis, running through the Zhengyang Gate, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Drum Tower, the Bell Tower, the glazed palace walls, imposing and majestic, with the tranquility of the surrounding courtyards, forming solid visual contrast, giving people a very incredible aesthetic feeling. In the distance, various kinds of buildings of different heights are very eye-catching in front of such a masterpiece of the city. I couldn’t bear to look away. I closed my eyes and hurriedly took my friends to find the old tree where Chongzhen had hung himself.</p>
